## demoLinearRegression
This is a demonstration of linear regression which I coded, based on an assignment from Andrew Ng.

## demoLogisticRegression
This is a demonstration of logistic regression which I compiled from the code at the yhat blog. Using the included packages, it achieves an approach similar to R. It demonstrates how one can quickly and easily perform logistic regression with Python using these packages.
