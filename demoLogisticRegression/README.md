# logistic regression

This is a simple demonstration of logistic regression in Python on a small dataset. It is compiled of the code portions given in the yhat blog article on logistic regression, reimplemented in Python 3:

Requires Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Pylab, and the dataset here:

Using these packages, an R-style implementation of logistic regression is achieved.
